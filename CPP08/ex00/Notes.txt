Detailed Comparison:
std::vector
Best Use: When you need fast random access and frequent insertion/deletion at the end.
Drawbacks: Inserting or deleting elements in the middle can be slow due to the need to shift elements.

std::list
Best Use: When you need frequent insertion/deletion in the middle of the sequence.
Drawbacks: Slow random access as it requires traversal from the beginning or end.

std::stack
Best Use: When you need a LIFO data structure.
Drawbacks: Only the top element is accessible; random access and iteration are not possible.

std::deque
Best Use: When you need fast insertion/deletion at both ends and random access.
Drawbacks: Slightly more memory overhead than std::vector.

std::queue
Best Use: When you need a FIFO data structure.
Drawbacks: Only the front and back elements are accessible; random access and iteration are not possible.

std::set
Best Use: When you need a collection of unique elements sorted in a specific order.
Drawbacks: Slightly higher memory usage due to the underlying tree structure.

std::map
Best Use: When you need to associate keys with values and ensure unique keys with sorted order.
Drawbacks: Slightly higher memory usage due to the underlying tree structure.

Conclusion:
Each container type is designed for specific use cases and has its own strengths and weaknesses.
Choosing the appropriate container depends on the operations you need to perform 
most frequently (e.g., random access, insertion/deletion, ordering) and the constraints of your application 
(e.g., memory usage, performance requirements).
